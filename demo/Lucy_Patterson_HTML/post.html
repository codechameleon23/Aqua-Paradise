                            <p>Exposure to stress, and especially chronic stress, is a major risk factor in gut problems. The gut has its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, which is sometimes called the body’s second brain. Because the central and enteric nervous systems are closely connected, it stands to reason to expect that stress has a profound effect on gut health. And it does.</p>

                            <p>Most people are familiar with the autonomic nervous system that regulates breathing, heart rate, body temperature and several other functions. One part of it also triggers the fight or flight response while the opposing part helps you to relax. The autonomic nervous system has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system (1). The sympathetic nervous system is often considered the “fight or flight” system, while the parasympathetic nervous system is often considered the “rest and digest”or “feed and breed” system.</p>

                            <p>The enteric nervous system has been described as a “second brain” for several reasons. The enteric nervous system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the parasympathetic (e.g., via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic (e.g., via the prevertebral ganglia) nervous systems. However, vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function (2).</p>

                            <p>The enteric nervous system is sometimes called as the second brain or the small brain because it relies on the same types of neurons and neurotransmitters found in the brain. Because of this close connection researchers have dubbed this as the gut-brain axis. This shared ‘language’ between the brain and the gut may also explain gut feelings and why we often experience emotions in the gut, such as feeling butterflies in the stomach before public speaking.</p>

                            <div class="post-img">
                                <div class="half">
                                    <img src="images/iStock-530418242.jpg"/>
                                </div>
                                <div class="half">
                                    <img src="images/iStock-544809990.jpg"/>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>But stress can do more than just give you butterflies. Because of the close connection between the brain and the gut, stress signals may have a wide ranging effects on the gut (9).</p>

                            <p>* Digestion slows or even stops completely during stressful times because the body directs energy to organs and systems required for responding to the threat.</p>

                            <p>* Stress slows gut motility, that is, it slows down movement of food through the gut. Motility refers to the speed</p>

                            <p>at which the intestinal track pushes food thought. Slow motility often leads to constipation and obstruction of the digestive track, and this can encourage the growth of pathogenic bacteria and SIBO.</p>
                            <p>* Stress weakens the gut barrier function (increases intestinal permeability). ‘Leaky gut walls’ allow inflammatory substances to enter the body.</p>

                            <p>* Stress lowers the number of probiotic bacteria in the gut and encourages the growth of pathogenic bacteria. In fact, some pathogenic bacteria can ‘read’ the stress signals the body sends and increase their virulence when you are stressed.</p>

                            <p>* Stress reduces gastrointestinal secretions (stomach acid and enzymes) and contributes to indigestion as well as symptoms like bloating. Digestion and secretion of digestive juices slows down during stress, or even completely halts during intense stress.</p>

                            <p>You may be able to see why stress has been implicated in nearly all gut-related health issues, such as GERD, peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome (IBD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s disease, coeliac disease and even food allergies.</p>

                            <p>Stress Causes “Leaky Gut”</p>
                            
                            <p>This section is adapted from an excellent article called “Does Stress Cause Digestive Problems” by Kelsey Marksteiner. To read the full article please copy and paste this link – <a href="http://www.mypaleorehab.com/doesstress-cause-digestive-problems/ ">http://www.mypaleorehab.com/doesstress-cause-digestive-problems/</a></p>
                            
                            <p>The gut barrier comes into contact with many different substances, from possibly harmful bacteria to food particles that need to be digested before being allowed into the body. When working normally, the gut lining acts as a sieve, only allowing particles that fit through to get to the other side. When the sieve breaks, things that aren’t supposed to get across now flow through freely. It’s essential that this barrier functions appropriately to keep the things we don’t want out and only allow the things we need in. When the gut barrier leaks, we’ve got a big problem.</p>
                            
                            <p>Researchers have known for a long time that severe physical stress such as trauma or surgery causes the intestinal lining to become “leaky”, but more recent research has started to look at the effect of chronic psychological stress on the gut barrier (3). To approximate chronic psychological stress in humans, rats are repeatedly subjected to water aversion stress where they are placed on a platform surrounded by water. Researchers have found that this is a mild stressor to the rats, similar to the type of chronic mild stressors we face today.</p>
                            
                            <p>So what happens to these rats? They develop intestinal permeability that takes several days of no stress to heal. (4) Yes, several days. When’s the last time you went several days without any stress whatsoever?</p>
                            
                            <p>This research has also shown that mast cells play a large part in the increased intestinal permeability that occurs as a result of stress. You may have heard of mast cells as the cells involved in allergic responses, as they are responsible for releasing histamine when they become unstable or “degranulate”, causing the typical allergic response – runny nose, watery eyes, congestion, etc.</p>
                            
                            <p>What you might not know about mast cells is that they’re also found along the gut’s mucosal wall and they contain CRH receptors. Remember, CRH is released at the start of the “fight or flight” reaction. Since mast cells have CRH receptors it means that they are responsive to the amount of CRH flowing through the body. When CRH attaches to mast cells, they degranulate and release their many chemicals, including histamine.</p>
                            
                            <p>Researchers studying rats under water aversion stress found that rats bred to have no mast cells in their intestines didn’t show increased intestinal permeability under stress, unlike their normal mast-cell containing counterparts (3). This tells us that mast cells play a very important role in the integrity of the gut lining when it comes to stress, and that unstable and degranulated mast cells lead to intestinal permeability. By stabilising these cells, we can help prevent the breach in our gut barrier.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>These rat studies give us a glimpse into what’s going on in our gut while under chronic psychological stress, and it’s not good. Hardly any of us can go a few days without being stressed about something, which never gives our gut barrier time to heal after it’s become permeable thanks to the unstabilised mast cells. Because of this, we’re leaving ourselves open to harmful substances not meant to enter our bodies.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>Stress affects Gut Flora<p>
                            
                            <p>Investigations in the past decade have shown that disturbances in the gut micro flora are common in anxiety, depression and chronic fatigue syndrome. There’s also some evidence that probiotic treatment improves emotional health (5).</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>A study of 1641 patients looked at the prevalence of anxiety and depression among people with some form of gut problem (IBS, IBD, celiac disease). The study found that 84% showed clinical signs of anxiety and 27% suffered from depression, rates that are far higher than that in the general population (6). A study (7) on the co-occurrence of depression and IBS found similar results. A questionnaire was sent to 5000 adults, out of which 3650 responded. The questionnaire assessed both gut health and depressive symptoms among the respondents. These results showed that IBS and gut-related complaints were far more common among people with depressive symptoms (54%) than in non-depressed controls (29%).</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>What You Can Do?</p>
                            
                            <p>If that all sounds a bit doom and gloom, I hope it serves to remind you of the complex interactions going on between our gut and our brain. So what can you do to support a healthier gut?</p>
                            
                            <p>Stress relief – literally ANYTHING that can help you to switch off and chill. Take some me time. My personal favourites are yoga classes, walking, time with friends, going to the cinema, gardening, using app’s such as headspace, and long baths. Early nights serve me well to. There are all sorts of additional ways to get some help here; tai chi, meditation classes, massage, reflexology, and practical ways such as getting a cleaner, a babysitter in, delegating work priorities, Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), aromatherapy, finding hobbies you enjoy and sharing time with people that make you feel GOOD and not drain you more.</p>
                            
                            <p>Given that we all love in a technology filled world, the hardest one I find, but one that makes the biggest difference is to find time for a ‘digital detox’ where I don’t check my phone, email, whats app, Facebook etc for as long as I can. It’s something I’m also working on; not checking work emails at night etc.</p>
                            
                            <p>Support your gut flora by eating plenty of fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, kombucha, miso, natto, tempeh, raw cheese if tolerated. Or taking a high quality probiotic supplement. Eating plenty of prebiotic foods to support healthy gut flora such as banana, onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus, sweet potato is also useful (please note many of these are not suitable for a low fodmap diet) and eating polyphenol rich food like blueberries, apples, green tea, cherries, turmeric can also support their growth.</p>
                            
                            <p>Avoiding foods known to disrupt gut flora such as processed carbohydrates, sugar and alcohol will also help. Interestingly I also researched an article that found making any kind of art can reduce cortisol and stress levels. The study looked at participants doing any form of 45 minute art class and found that 75% of them had lowered cortisol responses (8). Time to join that drawing class, get the water colours or camera out? Another unusual technique might be humming! Humming appears to exact a calming effect by stimulating the vagus nerve. Since the vagus nerve is connected to the vocal cords, humming mechanically stimulates it. High vagal tone improves the function of many body systems, causing better blood sugar regulation, reduced risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease, lower blood pressure, improved digestion via better production of stomach basic and digestive enzymes, and reduced migraines. Higher vagal tone is also associated with better mood, less anxiety and more stress resilience. One of the most interesting roles of the vagus nerve is that it essentially reads the gut microbiome and initiates a response to modulate inflammation based on whether or not it detects pathogenic versus non-pathogenic organisms.</p>
