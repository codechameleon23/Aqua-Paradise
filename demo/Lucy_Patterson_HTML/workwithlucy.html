                    <p>I am a registered Nutritional Therapist (NT) with 5 years clinical experience. I have been trained in Functional Medicine principles towards supporting health and am always looking to determine the root imbalance and easiest way to correct this with my clients. I have worked with hundreds of clients over several years on a variety of health conditions, and my training and experience – combined with my compassion and realistic view of health – makes me a well-prepared partner for you in your journey towards better physical and mental health</p>
                    <p>I graduated from the Institute for Optimum Nutrition in 2012 and have been in practice ever since. I am currently studying for my Masters degree in Advanced Nutrition Research and Practice, with a focus on individual carbohydrate tolerance and the gut micro biome.</p>

                        <p>My consultations require you to complete an online health questionnaire before we meet which will give me a good starting point before we meet. This includes a 3 day food diary.</p>
                        <p>When we meet we will have up to 90 minutes to have a really in depth discussion about your goals, your current and historic health issues, your family history, any events and relevant symptoms you are experiencing and go through your current diet. From here I will make
                        my assessment of what possible underlying imbalances there may be that are preventing you from achieving what you want. I will then
                        make recommendations to support you.</p>
                        <p>With some clients we will utilise cutting edge laboratory testing to identify imbalances and provide more targeted recommendations.
                        Please note these tests are additional to your consultation or package plan. Testing is optional and never obligatory.</p>
                        <p>You will then receive a detailed Nutritional Strategy following your consultation with my recommendations for how we will work together and what you can start to implement. There may be additional recipes and/or a supplement programme for you to provide you with extra support.</p>
                        <p>We will then aim to meet for 45 minute follow up sessions as often as is convenient for you. In my experience most people to best and feel more motivated to make changes when checking in every 2-3 weeks and being supported through at least 12 weeks to see the most benefits.</p>
                        <p>I now offer packages for us to work together over 12 weeks at a discounted rate to individual consults to demonstrate my commitment
                        to working with you and supporting you along your journey.</p>
