                    <p>Reiki is a gentle hands on healing therapy that is perfect for aiding relaxation and bringing a sense of well being to each individual.</p>
                    <p>Reiki originated in Japan and has been used as a technique for reducing stress, aiding relaxation and promoting a positive sense of well-being for centuries. It is based on the notion that energy, or chi flows through us and is what keeps us alive.</p>
                    <p>When this energy is low we can become ill or feel stressed, whereas if the energy is high,we are likely to be healthy and happy.</p>
                    <p>I place my hands on different positions on the head and body. There may be feelings of heat or coldness, pulsating or tingling or no feeling at all! Generally the client experiences a deep sense of relaxation during treatment and afterwards. A typical session lasts up to an hour.</p>
                    <p><b>Prices start from £40</b></p>

                    <p>Having your bars run is incredibly relaxing and nurturing, you don’t have to do or think about anything but instead you just lie down and receive. A session lasts up to an hour and you are free to talk or just float off into a world of your own.</p>
