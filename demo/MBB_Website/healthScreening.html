                <p>Asyra health screening is a totally non-invasive way to get<br>
                    information from the body about aspects of health that is<br>
                    balanced or imbalanced.</p>
                <p>Many people can benefit greatly from the insight obtained<br>
                    through bioenergetic testing. This type of screening is also<br>
                    known as MSA testing. Research concerning bio-energetic<br>
                    testing has been well documented in university studies<br>
                    using various methods of traditional diagnostics.</p>

                    <p>Asyra screening is a totally non-invasive way to get information from the body about aspects of health that is balanced or imbalanced. Readings are taken by holding two brass hand masses and tiny changes in the electrical skin resistance of your skin are monitored whilst different signals are output from the system. If you are familiar with Kinesiology, the process is similar but computerised and much faster.</p>
                    <p>The Asyra allows us to gain insight into health by detecting subtle imbalances in the body. It will detect nutritional deficiencies, toxic overload, mental/ emotional stress, metabolic/digestive issues, allergy and environmental sensitivity, hormonal imbalance as well as the presence of organisms in the body which may be affecting the body’s ability to heal such as candida, parasites, viruses or Lyme.</p>

                    <p>More and more of us are turning to nutrition as we become aware of the foods we are putting into our bodies and the potential negative effects they are having.</p>
                    <p>Once of the Asyra’s primary skills is to see on an energetic level, which foods and food groups are causing issues for an individual. Once we know what we are reacting to, we can take positive steps to eliminate a particular item or food group or just modify our eating habits.</p>
                    <p>Whether the symptoms you are experiencing are pain, bloating, lack of energy, headaches, moodiness, heartburn, constipation or diarrhoea, the Asyra will be able to detect the possible underlying causes. The Asyra will give us clues as to whether the food in question is causing an immediate inflammatory response or whether the effects are more lingering and chronic.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the Asyra is NOT a diagnostic instrument. If you want diagnosis for a specific condition then blood and stool testing is available through the NHS and private clinics.</p>
                    <p>For more information on how this training can help you please get in touch to book and appointment.</p>
